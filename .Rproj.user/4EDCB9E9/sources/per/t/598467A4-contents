# fcaR

```{r}
library("fcaR")
library("arules")
covid <- read.csv("COVID.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
head(covid)
fc_covid <- FormalContext$new(covid)
print(fc_covid)
fc_covid$plot()
fc_covid$objects
```

We find the implications and the concepts.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
S <- SparseSet$new(attributes = fc_covid$objects)
fc_covid$find_implications()
fc_covid$implications
```

As we can see, there are no implications. Maybe this could be fixed discretizing the columns with data about the patients and healed.

```{r}
fc_covid$find_concepts()
fc_covid$concepts
fc_covid$concepts$plot()
```

In this last plot we can see it's a quite small lattice, and it would require a deeper analysis to extract some conclusions.
